	<h2>Book Converter</h2>
	This script will allow you to convert any piece of text (ebooks, novels,
	plays, dialogues and more) to the (Stendhal) book format compatible in
	game.<br />
	<i>Please note this will trim every line breaks from the original text to
		avoid bugs. Therefore, chapters transitions might be esthetically
		unpleasant.<br />
		I recommend to put each chapter title in bold as this script leaves a few
		free characters per page to occasionally style the text in game for this
		purpose.</i><br /><br />

	<h3>How to?</h3>

	First, choose any text you would like to convert. It can be an ebook, an 
	article, or anything else, as long as it is text.<br />
	Then, you can type in the respective fields the name of the book and your
	nickname in game in the author field.<br /><br />

	Right after, you can press <strong>"Convert"</strong>. This will convert
	your text and automatically separate it in as many books it needs, taking in
	consideration Minecraft limitations. (If more than 100 pages, it will
	create another book etc.)<br /><br />

	When converting your text is over, you can click the newly appeared
	<strong>"Save Stendhal Books"</strong> button.<br />
	This will automatically download all the books, you just have to save the
	files when the popups appear.<br />
	After downloading the books, do not forget to move them to
	<strong>.minecraft\config\stendhal\books</strong> when you have the mod installed.<br />
	In a <strong>Book & Quill</strong> in game, you can then click on the
	<strong>"Import Book"</strong> button, and you will see your new book(s)
	ready to be imported.
