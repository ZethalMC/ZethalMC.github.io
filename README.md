# ZethalMC's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio hosted on GitHub! This portfolio showcases my projects, provides information about me, and offers a convenient way to get in touch. Feel free to explore the site and get to know more about my programming ventures and gaming endeavors.


### Website Overview

This website serves as my personal portfolio, utilizing the base code from [HTML5UP's Dimension](https://html5up.net/dimension). It's open-source and free to use, so feel free to adapt it for your own needs!

### Usage

1. Go to [HTML5UP's Dimension](https://html5up.net/dimension).
2. Download the base code.
3. Use it for your own!

### Future Projects

I plan to continually update and expand the website with new projects. Check out the [Projects](https://zethalmc.github.io/#projects) section for the latest additions.
